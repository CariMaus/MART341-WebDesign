1. Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?
This was my first experience learning HTML. I have never done any sort of coding so I found it very challenging. It was interesting to learn it because it feels like a foreign language. Learning where to place things properly is still a problem for me.

2. Next module we continue with CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?
I am excited to learn how to make the websites look more dynamic, instead of basic. I would like how to understand how to add colors and a variety of font better.

3. Free Response: Summarize your challenges and successes. What did you do to overcome your challenges?
My challenges revolve around the misplacement of tags. I believe I know where they should go and was even able to reference the examples provided, and yet I still couldn't get the page and text to be the colors I wanted. I solved most of my challenges by referencing the examples provided and previous learning material.
