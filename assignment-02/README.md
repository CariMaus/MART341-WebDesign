# MART341-WebDesign Cari
This week we created a repository and added text. I am very unsure of how github works and know I am going to need a lot more practice to get the hang of it. The biggest challenge is not knowing for sure if I am editng information in the correct area or following the steps correctly. Hopefully it will get easier the more times I have to navigate the different folders.
