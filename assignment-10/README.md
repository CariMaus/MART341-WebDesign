Your README file for this homework's repo should also include:

Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?
Universal selector is used to style every element on a page.
Element selector is used to select all elements of a certain type.
Class names assigned to HTML elements via the class="" attribute can also be used to style elements.
ID selector allows developers to define style rules for a specific element by calling its unique ID.

Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, RGB values, or hex codes.
My color scheme is a jamboree. I used some colors from the example given and then played with changing them to see how and where it would be altered. Some of the colors used are red, orange, gold, tomato, and light green.
Free Response: Please discuss any challenges you had this week and how you overcame them.
I am challenged by how to make all of the spacing and alignment work between all of the elements. I wanted to add padding between the images and the rainbow box but couldn't quite get the result I was looking for. I also wanted the images to line up side by side as a gallery but every time I messed with the dimensions or what I thought was spacing, the images would disappear. So I left it as it is.
