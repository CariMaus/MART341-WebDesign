      A Story About Puppies: These two puppies have saved me during the pandemic. They were born on May 2nd, 2020.
      I helped deliver them, as their mom had to have a cesarian. It was one of the most stressful experiences of my life.
      The vet did not have enough staff on hand as it was an emergengy visit at 10:00pm on a saturday night.
      I helped bring them to life by rubbing their tiny bodies vigorously, while sucking fluid from their nose and mouths.
      It was a fight to bring each of them to life, as it is usally the job of the mother. There is much more to the story.
      Long story short, I was albe to raise them from birth and hand pick them from the liter as my own.
